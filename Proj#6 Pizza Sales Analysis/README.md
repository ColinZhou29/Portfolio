## Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using **PostgreSQL** for querying and **Excel** for dashboard visualization.

The project demonstrates proficiency in database management and data visualization techniques to create a meaningful business analysis.

**Tools & Skills Used:**: 
- **PostgreSQL**: For querying and extracting sales data from the database.
- **Excel**: For data analysis, processing, and building a dashboard.
- **Data Analysis**: Analysis of sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior.
- **Visualization**: Visualized sales data with graphs, charts, and tables for better decision-making.
