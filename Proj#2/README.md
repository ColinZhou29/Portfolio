## Summary of Project
In this project, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilized to develop an advanced License Plate Recognition (LPR) system to improve upon traditional methods that struggle with variable conditions such as diverse plate formats, lighting, and viewing angles. By leveraging a dataset of Belgian license plates from Kaggle, the system classifies alphanumeric characters, using data augmentation to address real-world variances. The CNN architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling, and dropout layers to enhance model accuracy and prevent overfitting. The project demonstrates the LPR system's potential in urban traffic management, law enforcement, and commercial logistics, where automation can streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance efficiency. Future improvements could include adaptation to new formats and integration with broader surveillance systems, alongside considerations for privacy and regulatory compliance.
