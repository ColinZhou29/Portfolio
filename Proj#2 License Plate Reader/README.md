## Summary of Project
In this project, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilized to develop an advanced License Plate Recognition (LPR) system to improve upon traditional methods that struggle with variable conditions such as diverse plate formats, lighting, and viewing angles. By leveraging a dataset of Belgian license plates from Kaggle, the system classifies alphanumeric characters, using data augmentation to address real-world variances. The CNN architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling, and dropout layers to enhance model accuracy and prevent overfitting. The project demonstrates the LPR system's potential in urban traffic management, law enforcement, and commercial logistics, where automation can streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance efficiency. Future improvements could include adaptation to new formats and integration with broader surveillance systems, alongside considerations for privacy and regulatory compliance.

## Objectives
1. **Enhancing License Plate Recognition Accuracy**: The project aims to surpass traditional LPR systems by utilizing CNNs, which are known for their ability to handle visual data under challenging conditions like varied lighting, angles, and partial obstructions.

2. **Improving Traffic Management**: By automating processes such as toll collection and vehicle entry/exit in parking facilities, the system seeks to streamline urban traffic management and reduce congestion.

3. **Supporting Law Enforcement**: The advanced LPR system can assist in monitoring and identifying vehicles in real-time, aiding law enforcement in tasks like tracking stolen vehicles and enhancing public safety at checkpoints.

4. **Optimizing Parking and Logistics**: The project aims to improve operational efficiency in parking management and commercial logistics by reducing manual labor, increasing accuracy in fee collection, and preventing unauthorized access.
